# Porticode Project: What does it do?

Our 24hr project we created is a voting system to replace the one in the current UCL bars. It allows you to select a location and see what is currently playing, or look for a song on spotify and vote for it to be played next. The more votes a song has the higher up in the queue it goes. We integrated this with the Spotify API and also the UCL API. The UCL API was integrated to limit the number of votes you can submit to stop people taking sole control of the music.
